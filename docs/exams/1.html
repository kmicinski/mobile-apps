    <p>This is Exam 1 for CMSC 311. This exam contains 105 points. It will be
graded out of 100.</p>

<p>You may write your answers in whichever way you want: printing this
exam and writing on paper, writing inside of this document,
typesetting solutions in latex, etc…</p>

<p>All I care is that you do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t Google for any of the answers online</li>
  <li>Take no more than 8 hours on the test</li>
  <li>Cite any sources you use</li>
</ul>

<p>You are allowed to use the internet under the following circumstances:
you are accessing a manual for a specific program or a reference we’ve
looked up in class. For example, you may look up the GDB manual and
x86 instruction call reference, but you may <em>not</em> look up how to find
the base address of a function using GDB on StackOverflow. If you are
in doubt, write me an email. In other words, you may not Google for
answers on-demand.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(10 points) Define, compare, and contrast probabilistic defenses
versus deterministic defenses. Give at least one example of each. Are
they both useful?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(10 points) This question has two subparts.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>5/10 points: Give an example of a small snippet of code that has a
spatial memory safety bug.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>5/10 points: Describe under what circumstances (perhaps but not
necessarily using example code) a program would exhibit a temporal
memory safety bug.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="stack-smashing--buffer-overflows">(Stack Smashing / Buffer Overflows)</h4>

<p>Consider the following piece of code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Assume that the address of `shellcode` without ASLR is 0x100000000000ff00
char shellcode[] = 
"\x48\x31\xd2"                                  // xor    %rdx, %rdx
"\x48\xbb\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68"      // mov	$0x68732f6e69622f2f, %rbx
"\x48\xc1\xeb\x08"                              // shr    $0x8, %rbx
"\x53"                                          // push   %rbx
"\x48\x89\xe7"                                  // mov    %rsp, %rdi
"\x50"                                          // push   %rax
"\x57"                                          // push   %rdi
"\x48\x89\xe6"                                  // mov    %rsp, %rsi
"\xb0\x3b"                                      // mov    $0x3b, %al
"\x0f\x05";                                     // syscall

char *foo(int x, char *z) {
  // Assume that `buffer`'s address is 0x200000000000ff00
  // Assume that the saved instruction pointer is stored at 0x200000000000ff20
  char buffer[8];       // Line A
  // Line B
  while (x &gt; 0) {
    buffer[x] = z[x];
    x--;
  }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  char *hello = foo(strlen(argv[1]), argv[1]);
  // ...
  // You will describe something here.
  // 
  return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To simplify your task in the following, assume that you can call the
program with binary command-line arguments. In other words, assume
that you can give the program a command-line argument containing the
byte 0 (even though you couldn’t typically because that’s the end of a
C string).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(5 Points) Give me command line arguments to the program that would cause it to
crash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(10 Points) (Stack smashing) For now, assume that ASLR has been turned
off in our system. This means that each time the program starts, the
static data segment, code segment, stack, etc.. will all get the same
value each time the program is run. For this problem, assume that the
buffer <code class="highlighter-rouge">shellcode</code> is located at address <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x10000000ffaa0000</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Describe an input that would cause the program to execute the code in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">shellcode</code>.</p>

<h4 id="payload-injection">Payload injection</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(10 points) Now assume that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">shellcode</code> variable is removed from
the program. We can’t play the same trick as in the last
problem. Instead, we must inject the shellcode via the program’s
input. You may still assume that ASLR and NX are turned off, but for
this problem, assume that the base address of <code class="highlighter-rouge">buffer</code> is
<code class="highlighter-rouge">0x200000000000ff00</code>.` Describe an input that would inject the
shellcode and redirect execution to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(10 points) How would you change the program to eliminate this attack?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(5 points) Describe what the NX bit does. Why does it make it hard to
launch the attack described in problem 5?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="nop-sleds">NOP-sleds</h4>

<p>(5 points) A “NOP-sled” is a long sequence of NOPs before a payload
that is inserted into the program.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"\x66\x90"
"\x66\x90"
"\x66\x90"
... thousands more ...
"\x66\x90"
"\x66\x90"
"\x48\x31\xd2"                                  // xor    %rdx, %rdx
"\x48\xbb\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68"      // mov	$0x68732f6e69622f2f, %rbx
"\x48\xc1\xeb\x08"                              // shr    $0x8, %rbx
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Describe why a NOP-sled might be useful in the presence of ASLR or in
the scenario in which you weren’t certain where the program would be
loaded (e.g., because of variations in environment variables).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="heap-exploits">Heap exploits</h4>

<p>Assume that we had the following structure.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>struct person {
    // Address base+0
    unsigned int is_administrator;
    // Address base+4
    char username[50];
    // Address base+56
    char *(*login_shell)(char *);  // Pointer to C function that accepts a
                                   // string (char *) as an argument and returns a string (char *)
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assume the compiler lays out structured data for <code class="highlighter-rouge">person</code> in the
manner described in the comments. I.e., if the base address of the
struct is at address <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xAA00</code>, then the address of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">login_shell</code>
variable will be stored at <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xAA38</code>. You may assume the function
<code class="highlighter-rouge">system</code> is stored at the (8-byte) address <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x000000AAAAAA0000</code>.</p>

<p>Assume that after you are logged in, the program calls the function
pointed to by <code class="highlighter-rouge">login_shell</code> with the data stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">username</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>(10 points) Describe what you could put in <code class="highlighter-rouge">username</code> so that you
effected a call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">system("/bin/sh")</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="aslr--attack-theory">ASLR / attack theory</h4>

<ul>
  <li>(10 points) Assume that ASLR is enabled.  Are stack-canaries and
other memory-safety controls still relevant? If they are still
relevant, write an example program which demonstrates a vulnerability
that would exist even with ASLR. If not, explain how ASLR fixes the
problem stack canaries solve. (Big Hint: think about data-only
attacks, consider writing something like a password-checking program
that calls a function to copy a string.)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="control-flow-integrity">Control-flow integrity</h4>

<p>Consider the following program:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>void foo() {
  char buf[200];
  // .. 
  bar(); // Line 1
  // .. 
}

void bar() {
  char buf2[100];
  // .. 
  return; // Line 3;
}

void system() {
  // .. 
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(10 points) Control-flow integrity is a compile-time (or runtime, in
some cases) instrumentation of the program.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>2/10 points: What does control-flow integrity do, and why is it
helpful?</p>
      </li>
      <li>4/10 points: In the above program, how would the following be
transformed:
        <ul>
          <li>The call to bar() at line 1</li>
          <li>The return from bar() at line 3</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>2/10 points: How does CFI ensure the program can’t call system?</p>
      </li>
      <li>2/10 points: Assume we had provably perfect CFI. Would we have then
ensured memory-safety?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="systems-security-concepts">Systems Security Concepts</h4>

<ul>
  <li>(5 points) Programs that are Set-UID inherit the privileges of their owners when
they are called. For example, the program <code class="highlighter-rouge">ping</code> uses raw ICMP sockets
to check the status of remote hosts, which requires the program to
have the privileges of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">root</code> user.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 3-6 sentences, detail why such Set-UID programs warrant extra
attention from us.</p>

<ul>
  <li>(5 points) Consider that Process A contains secret data somewhere in its memory
space. For example, maybe it is a server process that stores grades
for the course. Sometimes, Process A might want to run untrusted code
(e.g., downloaded from the internet). If done by naively running code
in the same process space, this lead to security vulnerabilities,
because the untrusted code will have accesss to all of process A’s
memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>What operating-system principle could be used to allow process A to
run this untrusted code in a way so that the untrusted code does not
gain access to process A’s data?</p>
