    <p><strong>Caution!</strong> This code will be graded on the virtual machine for the
course. If your code does not run on that virtual machine, you will
not be counted as receiving credit.</p>

<p>In this project, you’ll implement a web application that serves and
retrieves files. Part of this server was implemented in the previous
project, but it didn’t actually do the work of storing files on disk
and properly responding to HTTP requests.</p>

<p>This portion of the project is group work. During the course of this
project you are allowed access to all online resources, but you are
required to cite any resource that gave you any significant insight
into the project, including conversations you had with those outside
of your group. You will put these sources in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SOURCES.md</code> within this
folder.</p>

<p>This project consists of two broad parts: attacks and
implementation. The attacks section will have you use ROP to get
around the NX bit and defeat modern defenses. The implementation
section will have you use defensive programming to implement the file
server. You can choose to divvy up these tasks in whatever way makes
sense for your group: you can all work on different parts, or work on
each part together. But by the end of the project, every team member
is responsible for understanding each part of the project (under
penalty of not understanding well and then getting a bad grade on the
exam). I recommend not getting <em>stuck</em> on one part, though, since they
are logically independent.</p>

<p>Please respect the department’s collaboration policy. Specifically,
you are not allowed to look at any other group’s <em>code</em> (or do
anything equivalent, such as talking through your code on a
line-by-line basis). You may discuss pseudo-code on the board, but
afterwards you must erase it (so as to not let anyone else see it) and
then cite your conversation with the other person in a comment in your
code (and in the sources file). <strong>Within</strong> your group you may
collaborate in whatever way you want.</p>

<p><strong>If you get stuck, look at the hints / advice at the bottom of this
guide.</strong></p>

<h1 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h1>

<p>The goal of this project is to teach you the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Launching a ROP-based exploit that defeats ASLR, NX, and stack canaries</li>
  <li>Defensive Programming</li>
  <li>Writing an HTTP server in a native language</li>
</ul>

<p>You should first obtain the starter files for this project, perform a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> of this project’s repository:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone github.com/security-course/file-server-group
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The starter code is contained in a file <code class="highlighter-rouge">server.c</code>. But in the later
part of the project, you’ll ditch that starter code and instead write
your own server using whatever libraries you want.</p>

<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>

<p>Specific examples that extend the collaboration policy for this lab:
Same as on Project 1I, except replace ever occurrence of “other
students” with “other groups.” This is to say, you may say whatever
you want to your groupmembers, but shouldn’t talk about low-level
details and addresses with other groups. I was quite satisfied with
the level of collaboration that happened on the last project, so keep
it up.</p>

<h2 id="attacks">Attacks</h2>

<p>In this part, we’ll be launching attacks against a security-hardened
version of the server. Our server still contains vulnerabilities, but
for this project ASLR will be turned <strong>on</strong>. I’ll also be turning on
the NX bit, meaning you can’t inject code into the program and execute
it.</p>

<h3 id="part-0-exploiting-aslr">Part 0: Exploiting ASLR</h3>

<p>In this part, you should look carefully at the implementation of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">server.c</code> and think about how you could get the server to return to
you the contents of the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">/proc/self/maps</code>. This will allow you to
defeat ASLR since you’ll be able to learn the base address of certain
values.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable</strong>: The function <code class="highlighter-rouge">dump_proc_self_maps</code> in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">client.py</code>. This function–when run–prints the contents of the
server’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">/proc/self/maps</code> to the screen of the <em>client</em>. (I.e., if I
run it in python I should see the address on the server.)</p>

<h3 id="part-1-mounting-a-ret-to-libc-attack">Part 1: Mounting a Ret-to-libc attack</h3>

<p>In this part, you’re just going to cause the server to shut down. This
is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial of service
(DOS)</a>
attack. You can’t inject code into the program to make it run <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code>,
so instead you’ll have to reuse the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code>, which is already
a part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">glibc</code>. Find it and run that.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable</strong>: The function <code class="highlighter-rouge">server_exit</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">client.py</code>. This
function–when run–causes the server to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> via a
return-to-libc attack.</p>

<p>Note that this will be run with ASLR turned <strong>on</strong>. This means that
you’ll have to parse the contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">/proc/self/maps</code> you get from
the previous part.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">server.c</code>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> command has
changed slightly. Instead of the command being</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>echo hello
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The new command is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>echo 5 hello
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The format is <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo NNNNN data</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">NNNNN</code> is a number of at most
five characters in length, followed by a space, followed by the
data. The number <code class="highlighter-rouge">NNNNN</code> specifies how much data to grab from <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code>
and put into <code class="highlighter-rouge">string</code>. This makes it so that you can input binary data
into the buffer <code class="highlighter-rouge">string</code> containing zeros.</p>

<p>Also note that the server prints out the socket being used, which will
be helpful in subsequent parts.</p>

<h3 id="part-2-finding-rop-gadgets">Part 2: Finding ROP gadgets</h3>

<p>In this part of the assignment, you’re going to use
return-oriented-programming to write the secret key out to the socket
so that the attacker gets it on the other end of the
wire. Essentially, you want to effect this sequence</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">%rax</code> contains 1</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">%rdi</code> contains the socket number (which you get from echo)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">%rsi</code> contains the base of the secret key (which you get from
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/proc/self/maps</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">%rdx</code> contains the length of the secret key (which doesn’t really
matter, just set it at something like 100)</li>
  <li>Finally, call <code class="highlighter-rouge">syscall</code></li>
</ul>

<p>To find gadgets, use the tool “Gadget Finder” in the EDB debugging
toolkit. I have included a copy of EDB on the virtual machine for the
class. For this part of the project, I recommend you either run the VM
with its GUI, or use X forwarding to forward EDB to XQuartz.</p>

<p>The gadget finder is available in EDB under the graphical menu
“Plugins -&gt; ROPTool.” It has a number of configurations that allow you
to select which parts of the code you want to search and which
operations you want to find.</p>

<p>Remember that it might be the case that there is no such gadget that
simply moves 1 into <code class="highlighter-rouge">%rax</code>. Instead, you might have to use a
combination of things (e.g., one that pops the top of the stack into
%rbx and then exchanges <code class="highlighter-rouge">%bx</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">%ax</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable</strong>: the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">rop_gadgets.txt</code> that lists the various
gadgets you will use for your attack and lists how you will weave them
together.</p>

<h3 id="part-3-executing-the-gadgets">Part 3: Executing the gadgets</h3>

<p>Now actually execute the attack. This attack must work even with ASLR
turned on, meaning that you’ll have to construct the payload on the
fly after reading <code class="highlighter-rouge">/proc/self/maps</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable</strong>: the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">rop</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">client.py</code> that performs a
ROP-based attack on the server to force it to dump the secret key.</p>

<h3 id="part-4-rop-with-stack-protection">Part 4: ROP with Stack Protection</h3>

<p>The version of the server I gave you for this assignment still has
stack canaries turned off. This makes it possible to exploit the
stack-based buffer overflows in the server. However, assuming the
stack protector were turned on, it would be harder to launch this kind
of an attack. Change the server so that it is susceptible to a
ROP-based attack but also with the stack protector turned on. Clearly
(since the stack protector is on) you won’t be able to use a
stack-based buffer overflow (at least one of the form
<code class="highlighter-rouge">strcpy(buffer)</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable</strong>: a file <code class="highlighter-rouge">server_exploitable_canaries.c</code> that is
exploitable with canaries turned on, and a description of how it would
be exploited (either as an attack via a Python function like the
previous parts, or a text-based description). Do your vulnerability
writeup in a file <code class="highlighter-rouge">how_to_exploit_canaries.txt</code> and possibly link to
any functions that launch the exploit.</p>

<h2 id="defenses--implementation">Defenses / Implementation</h2>

<p>The second part of your project will be to implement an HTTP-based web
app that acts as a file server and accepts HTTP verbs. Your file
server will serve and store files on disc. In the next assignment, you
will use this file server to store files (or you can throw it
away and reimplement it in Python, using this project as a learning
experience). During this part, you’ll also document different
security-related problems you thought about in code and how you
designed to confront them.</p>

<p>Along with your group, I recommend you read <a href="https://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/">HTTP Made Really
  Easy</a>. It doesn’t cover
  everything, but it covers enough to give you the gist.</p>

<p>For this project, you’ll be writing in any native language. I’ve
provided starter code in C. But you can choose to reimplement it in
C++ if you’d like (though the easiest thing to do would be to write in
C). If you’d rather, you can also write in Rust, Go, etc… as long as
it works with the tests scripts (which will call <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code>). I expect
most teams will write in C (I did while completing this project), and
if you choose to use another language I am not obligated to support
your learning it. If you want to be adventurous and choose another
(native) language, don’t let me stop you. Just make sure it works with
all of the tests.</p>

<p><strong>Careful</strong>: don’t just start extending <code class="highlighter-rouge">server.c</code> like you might be
tempted to. There is some advice at the end of this document that
details picking an HTTP library.</p>

<h3 id="server-setup">Server setup</h3>

<p>Your server must run as a binary file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">fs</code>. It must accept
<strong>two</strong> command-line arguments: the first is the port on which it will
server data. The second is the root directory from which it will serve
files. An example run of the server–and the one I will use in my
tests–looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./fs 8080 ./files secret_key
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will tell the server to start serving files from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">files</code>
directory on port 8080. Subsequently, I will refer to this
command-line argument as the “root directory.”</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to write a web server which serves files
on a given port. Your server must accept four “verbs” in the HTTP
protocol and behave as described in the following subparts. Note that
in each of these subparts, the headline is only the verb, not the
headers or body that follows it. If you’re stuck here, read about how
HTTP works: it will be useful for you to know about anyway.</p>

<h4 id="get-pathtofile-http11"><code class="highlighter-rouge">GET /path/to/file HTTP/1.1</code></h4>

<p>The server must respond to HTTP <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> requests and return files in a
number of MIME types. To see an example of this, start the server like
this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./fs 8080 ./files secret-key</code></p>

<p>Now open a web browser and point it at <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:8080</code>. You should
see a web page and a gif of a cat. Your job is to make sure that you
implement this HTTP request correctly (i.e., fixing all of the bugs
present in my implementation). You must also support more file types
than I am currently supporting: the MIME types need to be lined up
appropriately.</p>

<p>An example GET request looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET /sample.pdf HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Connection: keep-alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
User-Agent: python-requests/2.18.4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The constraints for <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[5 points] When the client (either a <code class="highlighter-rouge">telnet</code> user, a web browser, a
Python script, etc..) issues a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET /path/to/file</code> command to your
server, your server should respond by looking up the file
<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;root-directory&gt;/path/to/file</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2 points] If the file exists, it must <em>serve</em> that file in a
response and respond with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">200 OK</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2 points] If the file does <em>not</em> exist, it must respond with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">404
Not Found</code> and list the file which was not found.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2 points] If the file exists, but is <em>not</em> world readable, your
server <strong>must</strong> return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">403 Forbidden</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2 points] If–in looking up the file–you encounter a file which is
not world-executable, you must return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">403 Forbidden</code>. For
example, say that there is a file <code class="highlighter-rouge">files/myfolder/foo.txt</code>, and that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">myfolder</code>’s permissions are <code class="highlighter-rouge">770</code> (i.e., readable, writable, and
executable by user and group, but not readable, writable, or
executable by anyone else) then you must return <code class="highlighter-rouge">403</code>, even if
<code class="highlighter-rouge">foo.txt</code> is world readable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[5 points] Your server <strong>must never</strong> allow any request for any file
that is in any subdirectory of the root directory. For example, it
had better not leak <code class="highlighter-rouge">../../../../proc/self/maps</code> (or something like
that).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[5 points] In the case that the user attempts to <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> a folder, the
server must do something a bit special. It must return an HTML page
that returns a list of links to files within the folder. For
example, if the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">/path</code> contains the files <code class="highlighter-rouge">foo</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">bar</code>,
it should return a page something like this</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;</span>/path<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</span>/path<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"localhost:8080/path/foo"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>foo<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"localhost:8080/path/bar"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>bar<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="post-pathtofile-http11"><code class="highlighter-rouge">POST /path/to/file HTTP/1.1</code></h4>

<p>To allow the user to upload files, your server will respond to a POST
request. A POST request is an instruction that tells the server that
the client wants to create something on the server. In this case, that
will be a file.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of what a POST to our server looks like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /examplepdf.pdf HTTP/1.1;
Host: localhost:8080
Connection: keep-alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
User-Agent: python-requests/2.18.4

Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=d6e135d1e0f243bf8a931baf7e3ae35e

</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[10 points] <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST /path/to/file</code> should accept multipart-encoded
data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> is a fairly flexible HTTP verb, allowing a very general
interaction with the server. You don’t need to know everything about
it to accomplish the tasks in this project, but reading about it
might help make it more concrete.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2 points] Similarly to GET, POST must return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">403</code> if the request
traverses into a folder that is not world-executable or tries to
write a file that is not world writable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[2 points] POST should return <code class="highlighter-rouge">400</code> (invalid request) if the
filename that the user tries to write is invalid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[5 points] In the case that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> tries to put the file in a
folder that does not yet exist, the folder should be created. So,
for example, if the client <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code>s data to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/path/to/file</code> and only
the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">path</code> exists, the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">to</code> should be created (as long
as <code class="highlighter-rouge">path</code> is executable and writable).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="put-pathtofile-http11"><code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT /path/to/file HTTP/1.1</code></h4>

<p>[2 points] This should do the same thing as POST, except that in the
case the file does not yet exist it should return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">400</code>.</p>

<h4 id="delete-pathtofile"><code class="highlighter-rouge">DELETE /path/to/file</code></h4>

<p>[5 points] As long as the permissions are correct (i.e., the file does
not lie on a path wherein you traverse into a folder that isn’t
world-executable, and the ultimate file and folder are world
writable), the file will be deleted. Return <code class="highlighter-rouge">404</code> in the case the file
does not exist, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">403</code> in the case of a permissions violation.</p>

<h4 id="summary-of-commands">Summary of commands</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">GET /path/to/file</code> Fetches a file, ensuring permissions are
correct. Also note that for directories, GET will return an HTML
page that gives links to the files contained within the directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">POST /path/to/file</code> Uploads a file, ensuring that permissions are
correct and creating necessary subdirectories. Multipart-encoded
form data must be supported. See the test in <code class="highlighter-rouge">test_post_file.py</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT /path/to/file</code> Updates an already-existing file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">DELETE /path/to/file</code> Deletes an existing file</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preventing-external-traffic">Preventing External Traffic</h3>

<p>This part is worth 5 points.</p>

<p>Your server is very vulnerable. You’ve now made something that allows
anyone that can talk to your computer to be able to store and read
files on it. This is certainly a bad idea. So you should turn it off.</p>

<p>Read this guide and figure out how to block incoming and outgoing
traffic to port <code class="highlighter-rouge">8080</code> (or whatever port you decide to use). (Note
that you might need to read other guides too, generally: google around
for how to do this.)</p>

<p>https://www.thegeekdiary.com/centos-rhel-how-to-block-incoming-and-outgoing-ports-using-iptables/</p>

<p>When you figure it out, write a shell script <code class="highlighter-rouge">block_ports.sh</code> that does
this.</p>

<p>The reason this is important is that when we move on to the next part
of the assignment you’ll write a chat server. Your chat server will
eventually hook up to this server to store the files.</p>

<h3 id="denial-of-service-dos-prevention">Denial-Of-Service (DOS) Prevention</h3>

<p>This part is worth 6 points.</p>

<p>Right now, if I open up a <code class="highlighter-rouge">telnet</code> connection to the server, the
server will be “tied up” in the sense that I can’t open up another
connection to the server in another terminal. This is bad: it means
that an attacker could take the server offline simply by taking too
long to complete their request.</p>

<p>You must figure out how to solve this problem. To do so, you should
use either processes or threads to handle each incoming connection
into the server. This will make your server a bit better. Of course,
industrial-strength server setups also include a number of other
network-based protection mechanisms (such as blocking whole swaths of
IP ranges when they flood the server with too many requests).</p>

<h2 id="server-tests-and-example-implementation-in-python">Server tests and Example Implementation in Python</h2>

<p>There are a few tests you can execute against your server. Be careful
to modify the tests so that they point at the proper port.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">test_get.py</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">test_get_harder.py</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">test_post_file.py</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">test_put_file.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I am <strong>not</strong> giving you every single test I will use. This
is by design. I have given you a specification I will use, and will
test your submission using various combinations of this and the tool
<a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>.</p>

<p>You are required to write your own tests for this project, possibly in
Python, shell scripts, etc.. While I will not explicitly grade these,
I reserve the right to lower your grade if you don’t have at least a
few tests for big features.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of how the assignment should work, I have written
an example implementation in Python. It is in the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">server.py</code>. I
recommend you look it over and try to see what it’s doing. Your
implementation should have a similar flavor. But it will probably be
quite a bit more work, since you’ll need to figure out which libraries
to use, and C is just going to be more verbose than Python no matter
what.</p>

<p>Note that you’ll have to install a few python packages to use that
server. You’ll have to do a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo pip install</code> to get them. I have a
file <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup_tests.sh</code> that will do this.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-ethics-and-realness">Notes on Ethics and “realness”</h2>

<p>You would not want to use this server in practice, because it’s just
an HTTP server. In particular, anyone looking at your connection will
be able to snoop all of the data you transfer (including the
files). One way to fix this is to use HTTPS, which runs HTTP over
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL</a>. This
allows all of the communication with the server to be encrypted. Your
server does <em>not</em> implement SSL/TLS. So if you want to use it to store
files for the next part of the assignment, the smart thing to do is to
wall off the port and use it only for local traffic.</p>

<h2 id="compiling-your-code">Compiling Your Code</h2>

<p>You might ask how you compile your code. This is your job to figure
out. I would most prefer it if you use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code>. If you’re using
libraries, you better include them. Basically, I need to be able to
figure out how to build your code easily, and it is your job to figure
out how to do it. If in doubt, ask the people in the class that have
more experience with low-level programming. It is totally fine to
collaborate on things like Makefiles at any extent, as long as you
don’t collaborate on the main source files (outside of your group:
within your group do whatever you want).</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<p><em>Note</em>: Deliverables will be accepted in no other format than those
listed here. Specifically: if you write code that technically works,
but does not fit the format the testing scripts expect, you will not
receive points. Also note that <em>no partial credit</em> will be assigned
throughout the course as a matter of policy, unless otherwise noted
explicitly.</p>

<p>Defenses:</p>

<p>Part 0: <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code>`</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/5 Basic file lookup</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/2 If the file exists, it must <em>serve</em> that file in a response
and respond with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">200 OK</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/2 If the file does <em>not</em> exist, it must respond with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">404
Not Found</code> and list the file which was not found.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/2 If the file exists, but is <em>not</em> world readable, your
server <strong>must</strong> return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">403 Forbidden</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/2 If–in looking up the file–you encounter a file which is
not world-executable, you must return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">403 Forbidden</code>. For
example, say that there is a file <code class="highlighter-rouge">files/myfolder/foo.txt</code>, and that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">myfolder</code>’s permissions are <code class="highlighter-rouge">770</code> (i.e., readable, writable, and
executable by user and group, but not readable, writable, or
executable by anyone else) then you must return <code class="highlighter-rouge">403</code>, even if
<code class="highlighter-rouge">foo.txt</code> is world readable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/5 Your server <strong>must never</strong> allow any request for any file
that is in any subdirectory of the root directory. For example, it
had better not leak <code class="highlighter-rouge">../../../../proc/self/maps</code> (or something like
that).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/5 In the case that the user attempts to <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> a folder, the
server must do something a bit special. It must return an HTML page
that returns a list of links to files within the folder. For
example, if the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">/path</code> contains the files <code class="highlighter-rouge">foo</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">bar</code>,
it should return a page something like this</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Part 1: <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/10 <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST /path/to/file</code> should accept multipart-encoded
data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/2 POST must return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">403</code> if the request traverses into a folder
that is not world-executable or tries to write a file that is not
world writable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/2 POST should return <code class="highlighter-rouge">400</code> (invalid request) if the filename
that the user tries to write is invalid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ ]/5 In the case that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> tries to put the file in a folder
that does not yet exist, the folder should be created. So, for
example, if the client <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code>s data to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/path/to/file</code> and only the
folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">path</code> exists, the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">to</code> should be created (as long as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">path</code> is executable and writable).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Part 2: <code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>[ ]/2 This should do the same thing as POST, except that in the case
the file does not yet exist it should return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">400</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part 3: <code class="highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>[ ]/5 Implementation of DELETE as described above.</li>

<h2 id="personal-advice-on-accomplishing-this-project">Personal Advice on Accomplishing this Project</h2>

<p>With the proper selection of tools, this assignment should not be an
overwhelming amount of work. In particular, avoid parsing HTTP
manually: that’s error prone and it’s going to get complicated
fast. You likely have not had extensive exposure to HTTP before this
project, and possibly not extensive socket programming experience
either. Because of that, make sure you start early. Budget time to
learn about HTTP. Most of the time, the best way to figure things out
is to start hacking on something.</p>

<p>Right now, the server is written to manually parse the HTTP
request. In general, you shouldn’t do that: you’re going to expend a
ton of time and effort and probably get it wrong. Instead, I recommend
that you use a library that parses HTTP requests for you. Here are a
few I think might help you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser</li>
  <li>https://github.com/h2o/picohttpparser</li>
  <li>https://github.com/iafonov/multipart-parser-c</li>
  <li>https://github.com/Samsung/http-parser</li>
  <li>https://github.com/francoiscolas/multipart-parser</li>
  <li>https://github.com/soywod/c-request</li>
  <li>https://github.com/nekipelov/httpparser</li>
  <li>https://github.com/AndreLouisCaron/httpxx</li>
  <li>https://github.com/c9s/h3</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these parsers are callback-based: you set them up and they
call back a function whenever you’ve read all of the data. So–for
example–you can set them up to call one of your functions when
they’ve read all of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> request, and then you get a pointer to
it (and its length), which you can use to write it to a file.</p>

<p>Remember that the point of this project is to practice writing secure
code. Using other people’s libraries can be helpful: if they’ve
written code well, then it saves you time. But if you pull some random
student’s HTTP parser off github and use it in your project, you
should be mindful it might have bugs: these will come back to bite you
(i.e., <em>lower your grade</em>) later in the “break it” phase of the final
project when other students find bugs in the code you
included. Therefore, make sure to read over the code you include.</p>
